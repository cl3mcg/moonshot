Maybe a barge option for the precarriage.
Hanover may offer different options
1 by truck valid for 1 months, cannot be selected for this tender.
1 option by barge - valid till end of year - Rates interesting - Depends on the carrier - 520.00 EUR Salzgitter per container - Rates for MSC are not known and can be requested
2 hours free loading time (matching customer's requi.) - Additional free time +70.00 EUR is OK as per Round 1 offered rates.

Current buying for MSC O/F: 2,250.00 USD
Selling 2,575.00 USD

Around 500 USD as buffer that can be used to increase the free time ???
Cost of additional free time at origin with MSC after 9 days 40' in HAM : 80 EUR per day (next 5 days) - 120.00 EUR after (this shouldn't be necessary as MAN asks for 14 days).
Storage free time with MSC 5 days free - And 70 EUR per 40'

We asks the feedback to the account owner. He will come back to us.
